> An entry to the [GMTK Game Jam 2019](https://menderbug.itch.io/trone).

A one-button Tron clone for 2-4 local players. Choose a key when the game starts and then press it when the steering wheel points in your direction of choice.

Picking up items messes with the steering wheel of all opponents. You can freeze, slow down, speed up or reverse their steering wheels, and you can disable one of their sectors.

You get one score point for each opponent who crashes before you.
